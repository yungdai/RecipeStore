/*
 For the save: method, we first grab the managed object context via AppDelegate and then create a NSManagedObject for the new recipe. To use Core Data Framework, the model objects should be instances of NSManagedObject or instances of classes that inherit from NSManagedObject. Recalled that we’ve created a subclass or NSManagedObject named Recipe in the data model, we use it to associate with the entity.
 To create a new instance of NSManagedObject for the Recipe entity, we use the insertNewObjectForEntityForName: method of the NSEntityDescription class to create a managed object. With the Recipe managed object, we then populate its properties with the values collected from the form. Lastly, we call up the save: method of the context to save the object into database. Always remember that the change of the model objects will not be saved to the persistent store until the save: method is called.
 Finally, it’s the cancel: method. For the method, we simply invoke the dismissViewControllerAnimated: method to dismiss the current view controller when user taps the cancel button.
